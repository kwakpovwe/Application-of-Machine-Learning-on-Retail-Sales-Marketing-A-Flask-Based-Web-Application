## Project Overview

- This project, "Application of Machine Learning on Retail Sales Marketing," is a Flask-based web application that leverages advanced machine learning models to forecast sales and demand in the retail and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors. It provides businesses with precise, real-time forecasting capabilities to optimize decision-making processes related to inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies. By addressing the limitations of traditional statistical methods, this project ensures robust, accurate, and scalable solutions for complex retail environments.
Key Features

## Multi-Model Machine Learning Pipeline:
 - Integrates cutting-edge models like LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Provides comparative analysis of models using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE.

## Interactive Web Application:
- Built using Flask, providing an intuitive interface for users to input data and generate forecasts dynamically.

## Real-Time Predictions:
- Seamless deployment of trained models for live forecasting using operational sales data.

## Feature Importance Visualization:
- Identifies and ranks key factors influencing sales, helping stakeholders understand drivers of performance.


## Scalable Architecture:
        Designed to handle large datasets and adapt to evolving business requirements.

## Motivation
- Sales and demand forecasting are crucial for managing supply chains, optimizing inventory, and driving profitability in the retail and FMCG sectors. Traditional statistical models like ARIMA often fail to account for non-linear relationships and are heavily dependent on manual expert intervention. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide automated, scalable, and accurate forecasting solutions. The Flask-based deployment ensures accessibility across a range of users, from technical analysts to non-technical business managers.
Project Architecture

## The project is structured into the following components:


## Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and engineers relevant features.

## Model Training:
- Implements advanced machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning.

## Model Evaluation:
- Compares models based on performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

## Web Deployment:
- Deploys the best-performing model as a Flask-based web application.

## Visualization:
- Provides graphical representations of feature importance, correlation matrices, and model performance.

## Dataset Overview

- The project utilizes a retail sales dataset from a chain of Big Mart stores. The dataset includes:

-- Independent Variables:
        Product-related attributes: Item weight, visibility, MRP, type.
        Outlet-related attributes: Size, location type, outlet age.
    Target Variable:
        Sales performance for each product.

Data preprocessing steps include:

    Imputing missing values (e.g., mode-based for categorical attributes, mean-based for numerical attributes).
    Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding and target encoding.
    Engineering new features, such as Outlet Age, to capture temporal trends.

Machine Learning Models

The following models are implemented and compared:

    Linear Regression: Baseline model for comparison.
    Random Forest: Ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees.
    LightGBM: Gradient boosting framework optimized for speed and accuracy.

    Gradient Boosting: Tree-based ensemble model.

Evaluation Metrics:

    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
